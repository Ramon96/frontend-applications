Hier komt een leuke afbeelding zodra er iets te zien valt.

# Description
During this course I created a web app from scratch with the help of React. I did some [research](https://github.com/Ramon96/frontend-applications/wiki) what the benefits of using a Framework are and the power of React really is about.
